## Introduction

### What is PharmacoExploreR?

PharmacoExploreR is an R package that is designed to simply the exploratory 
analysis of pharmacogenomic data. Pharmacogenomics combines molecular profiling 
data with drug response measurements with the goal of identifying biomarkers of 
drug sensitivity. Building off of the PharmacoGx package, this package aims to
make working with **PharmacoSet** objects (standardized objects for storing 
pharmacogenomic data) easier by allowing users to extract meaningful insights
and create figures.

PharmacoExploreR provides:

- **User-friendly functions** for common analytical workflows
- **Correlation analysis** between gene expression and drug response
- **Sample classification** into sensitive and resistant groups
- **High-quality visualizations** including volcano plots, scatterplots, 
boxplots, and dose-response curves
- **Streamlined workflows** for hypothesis generation


### What are PharmacoSets?

A **PharmacoSet** (PSet) is a standardized R object created by the PharmacoGx 
package that contains:

- **Molecular profiling data**: Gene expression, mutations, copy number 
variations
- **Drug sensitivity data**: Measurements like Area Under the Curve (AUC) or 
IC50 values
- **Sample metadata**: Information about cell lines or patient samples
- **Drug metadata**: Information about therapeutic compounds tested


### Key Terminology:

- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: A measure of drug sensitivity. Lower AUC 
values indicate greater sensitivity to the drug.
- **AAC (Area Above the Curve)**: The inverse of AUC. Higher AAC values indicate 
greater sensitivity.
- **IC50**: The drug concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50%.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical method to identify genes whose 
expression levels are associated with drug response.



## 1: Loading a PharmacoSet 
First, we load a publicly available pharmacogenomic dataset from PharmacoGx. 
The NCI60 dataset contains gene expression and drug sensitivity data for 60 
cancer cell lines tested against hundreds of compounds. This will be stored in
the pset variable for later use.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load NCI60 dataset
pset <- loadPSet("NCI60_2021")
```



## 2. Inspecting the PharmacoSet Structure

- `@molecularProfiles`: Gene expression and other molecular data
- `@treatmentResponse`: Drug sensitivity measurements
- `@sample`: Cell line metadata
- `@treatment`: Drug metadata


```{r}
# Inspect the PSet to understand what is available
slotNames(pset)

# Look at the names of molecular profiles
names(pset@molecularProfiles)

# Examine the treatment response structure
names(pset@treatmentResponse)

# See the type of each component without printing all the data
lapply(pset@treatmentResponse, function(x) class(x))

# Example: check the first few entries of raw sensitivity data
head(pset@treatmentResponse$raw[, , "Viability"], 3)

# Example: get available molecular data types
names(pset@molecularProfiles)

# Example: get available sensitivity measures
names(pset@treatmentResponse$profiles)

```

Here we observe the raw data containing dose-response measurements.
Each row represents a cell line while each column is a drug and values represent
the cell viability at a particular drug concentration.

```{r}
# List available drugs and cell lines
cat("Number of drugs:", length(drugNames(pset)), "\n")
cat("Number of cell lines:", length(cellNames(pset)), "\n")
cat("\nFirst 10 drugs:\n")
head(drugNames(pset), 10)
cat("\nFirst 10 cell lines:\n")
head(cellNames(pset), 10)
```

These commands allow us to identify which drugs and cell lines are available in
the dataset, helping us to choose appropriate drugs for our analysis.


## 3: Correlating Gene Expression with Drug Response

Now we can identify specific genes whose expresion levels are associated with
drug sensitivity using the **correlateExpressionAUC()** function. This function
extracts gene expression data for all genes as well as drug sensitivity data 
(AAC) for the specified drug. Then it is able to compute Pearson correlation
between each gene's expression and drug sensitivity across all cell lines, and 
calculate p-values to assess statistical significance. These p-values are also
adjusted for multiple testing using FDR (False Discovery Rate).


```{r}
drug <- "Erlotinib"
res <- correlateExpressionAUC(pset, mDataType = "rna", sensitivity.measure = "aac_recomputed", drug = drug)

# View top results
head(res)
```

## 4: Vizualizing Gene-Drug Relationships with Scatterplots

Now let's visualize the relationship between a specific gene's expression and
drug response using **plotExprAUC()**. This function extracts the expression 
values for the specified gene across all cell lines and the AAC values for the 
specified drug across the same cell lines. It then creates a scatterplot showing
the relationship with a regression line to visualize the trend, and displays 
correlation coefficient and p-value on the plot.

```{r}
# Select the most highly correlated gene
gene_of_interest <- res$gene[which.max(abs(res$cor))]
drug_of_interest <- "Erlotinib"

scatter_plot <- plotExprAUC(
  pset = pset,
  corResults = res,
  gene = gene_of_interest,
  mDataType = "rna",
  sensitivity.measure = "aac_recomputed",
  drug = drug_of_interest,
  method = "pearson"
)

print(scatter_plot)


```

## 5: Creating a Volcano Plot for Genome-Wide Overview
A volcano plot provides us with an overview of all gene-drug correlations at the
same time. We will use **volcanoAUC** to plot the correlation strength (x-axis)
against the statistical significance (y-axis), highlighting genes that pass both
correlation and significance thresholds.


```{r}
# Volcano plot using the results from correlateExpressionAUC
volcano_plot <- volcanoAUC(
  corResults = res,
  corThreshold = 0.3,
  pvalThreshold = 0.05
)

print(volcano_plot)

```

## 6: Classifying Samples into Response Groups

For our analysis we may also want to classify cells into "sensitive" and 
"resistant" groups, which we accomplish using **defineResponseGroups()**. This 
function allows us to use multiple methods (demonstrated below) to split cell
lines into the appropriate category.


```{r}
# Using median split
response_groups <- defineResponseGroups(pset, drug_of_interest, sensitivity.measure = "aac_recomputed", method = "median")
table(response_groups)

# Using quantiles (bottom 25% sensitive, top 25% resistant)
response_groups_q <- defineResponseGroups(pset, drug_of_interest, sensitivity.measure = "aac_recomputed", method = "quantile")
table(response_groups_q)

# Using manual threshold
response_groups_manual <- defineResponseGroups(pset, drug_of_interest, sensitivity.measure = "aac_recomputed", method = "manual", threshold = 0.6)
table(response_groups_manual)

```

## 7: Differential Expression Analysis
Now we can identify any genes that are differentially expressed between
sensitive and resistant cell lines using the **runDiffExpr()** function.


```{r}
# Define groups
response_groups <- defineResponseGroups(pset, drug_of_interest, sensitivity.measure = "aac_recomputed", method = "median")

# Run differential expression
diff_expr_res <- runDiffExpr(pset, groupLabels = response_groups, mDataType = "rna", method = "t.test")

# Inspect top genes
head(diff_expr_res[order(diff_expr_res$adj_pval), ])

```


## 8: Visualizing Gene Expression by Response Group
This package has multiple useful functions for visualizing how a specific gene's
expression differs between sensitive and resistant groups. Here we use 
**plotGeneBoxplot()** to create boxplots as well as violin plots to observe
these relationships.


```{r}
# Assume response_groups was created with defineResponseGroups()

# Boxplot
p1 <- plotGeneBoxplot(pset, gene_of_interest, response_groups, mDataType = "rna", plotType = "boxplot")
print(p1)

# Violin plot
p2 <- plotGeneBoxplot(pset, gene_of_interest, response_groups, mDataType = "rna", plotType = "violin")
print(p2)

```


## 9: Plotting Dose-Response Curves

Finally, we want to visualize the actual dose-response relationships for
specific cell lines using **plotDoseResponse()**. This function extracts raw 
dose-response data for the specified cell lines and drug, plotting cell 
viability (y-axis) against drug concentration (x-axis). Each curve represents 
one cell line, showing how cell viability decreases as drug 
concentration increases.

```{r}
# Pick 3 valid cell lines from the available ones
validCellLines <- rownames(pset@treatmentResponse$raw[, , "Viability"])
cellLines <- validCellLines[1:3]

# Plot dose-response curves
plotDoseResponse(pset, cell.lines = cellLines)
```
