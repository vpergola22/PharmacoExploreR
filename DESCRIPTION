Description: Provides reproducible and user-friendly tools for exploratory 
    pharmacogenomic data analysis with PharmacoGx. Simplifies workflows for 
    exploring relationships between drug response data (AUC, IC50) and molecular 
    features such as gene expression from PharmacoSet objects. Includes 
    functions for correlation analysis, sample classification, and high-quality 
    visualizations including volcano plots and dose-response curves.
